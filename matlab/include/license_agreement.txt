The MathWorks, Inc. Software License Agreement


1. DEFINITIONS. 

    1.1. "Licensee" means you, whether an individual or an entity, to whom
    MathWorks grants the License, and who is responsible for complying with the
    contractual obligations of the License, and ensuring that anyone permitted
    access to the Programs also complies with such obligations.

    1.2. "Affiliate" means a legal entity which is controlled by, or controls,
    or is under common control with Licensee.  Control means (i) beneficial
    ownership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the voting securities of a
    corporation or other business organization with voting securities, or (ii)
    a fifty percent (50%) or greater interest in the profits and capital of a
    partnership or other business organization without voting securities,
    provided that no other individual or entity other than the Licensee also
    has an equal fifty percent (50%) ownership or interest in the legal entity.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless MathWorks provides its express
    written consent to treat the entity as an Affiliate, an Affiliate shall not
    include any entity that MathWorks has expressly refused to license (or
    grant access under a license to) its software products or that had a

    for student and similar competitions, course support, research, fellowship
    participation, and teaching assistance, contravene any additional
    restrictions set forth in the award letter provided to Licensee.

6. ADDITIONAL FEES. The fees for the License are determined based upon the
country where all Licensed User(s) are principally located.  Additional fees
may apply to a transfer of the License, or the principal location of any
Licensed User, to another country, or to contract for global use.  MathWorks
may restrict a transfer of a License to another country or restrict its use in
another country if MathWorks reasonably believes that such transfer or use will
result in a breach of this Agreement.

7. RETENTION OF RIGHT, TITLE AND INTEREST BY MATHWORKS AND ITS LICENSORS.  The
Programs shall at all times remain the property of MathWorks and/or MathWorks'
Licensors and Licensee shall have no right, title, or interest therein, except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement.  Licensee shall take appropriate
action by instruction, agreement, or otherwise with any persons permitted
access to the Programs, so as to enable Licensee to satisfy its obligations
under the terms of this Agreement, including disabling access to the Programs,
in the event of a transfer of the License. 

8. LICENSES FOR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DATA.  MathWorks has been
granted licenses to distribute certain Third Party Software as part of or
included with the Programs licensed.  These licenses require MathWorks to
distribute the software to Licensee subject to specific terms and conditions,
which may provide rights and impose restrictions for use of the Programs,
including deployment of Applications, that are different from or additional to
those contained herein.  Should such Third Party Software be provided under the
Lesser General Public License, Licensee may make modifications of the work
identified in Section 6 of the Lesser General Public License for Licensee's own
use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.  Licensee agrees
that acceptance of this Agreement also confirms Licensee's acceptance of any
applicable Third Party Software licenses. Such Third Party licenses may be
viewed at mathworks.com/thirdpartylicenseagreementsR2016b.  Certain MathWorks
Programs may also provide an interface to facilitate Licensee's use of Third
Party services and data governed by the terms and conditions set forth in such
Third Party's applicable agreements with Licensee. This Agreement does not
grant any additional rights to access or use such Third Party services or data
made accessible through the use of MathWorks Programs.

9. SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE SERVICE. During any paid Software Maintenance Service
term, if applicable, MathWorks shall provide its customary Software Maintenance
Service for the licensed Programs which consists of:  delivering subsequent
releases of the Programs, if any, that are not charged for separately; exerting
reasonable efforts to both (a) provide, within a reasonable time, workarounds
for any material programming errors in the current release of the Programs that
are directly attributable to MathWorks, and (b) correct such errors in the next
available release, provided Licensee provides MathWorks with sufficient
information to identify the errors.  During this same paid Software Maintenance
Service term, Licensee shall also be entitled to receive technical support for
the current release.  Technical support means assistance by telephone, web, and
e-mail with the installation and/or use of the then-current release of the
licensed Programs, including all available bug fixes and patches, and their
interaction with supported hardware and operating systems ("Platforms").
Software Maintenance Service may provide access to certain online features and
services made available by MathWorks from time to time.  Licensee understands
and agrees that access to such online capabilities shall expire unless Licensee
renews its Software Maintenance Service.  MathWorks reserves the option to
discontinue, in whole or in part, and at any time, offering Software
Maintenance Service and/or technical support for any Program, feature of a
Program, or Platform or to refuse to provide Software Maintenance Service to a
Licensee whom it reasonably believes is in breach of this Agreement. 

10. LICENSE DURATION ("TERM").  This Agreement shall continue until the earlier
of (a) termination by MathWorks or Licensee as provided below, or (b) such time
as there are no Programs being licensed to Licensee hereunder.  

    10.1. For Annual Licenses:  Licensee understands and agrees that each
    Annual License and associated Software Maintenance Service will expire
    automatically and the Programs will stop operating promptly after its
    corresponding one (1) year period, unless Licensee renews its License by
    remitting the then-current annual License fee and provided the Licensee
    always remains in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. 

    10.2. For Term Licenses:  Licensee understands and agrees that each Term
    License and associated Software Maintenance Service will expire
    automatically and the Programs will stop operating promptly after the
    corresponding period of the term licensed, unless Licensee renews its
    License by remitting the then-current term License fee and provided the
    Licensee always remains in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

    10.3. For Perpetual Licenses:  Licensee shall have the right to use the
    Programs indefinitely, subject to the termination provisions in this
    Agreement.  Licensee understands and agrees that the Software Maintenance
    Service for each Perpetual License will terminate automatically upon
    expiration of the initial Software Maintenance Service term included with
    the acquisition of the License.  Thereafter, the Software Maintenance
    Service term may be renewed for any Program, at the then-current price, and
    for the then-applicable term, as long as MathWorks offers such Software
    Maintenance Service for such Program and provided the Licensee always
    remains in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

    10.4. For Student Licenses and Home Licenses:  See the Student License and
    Home License Installation and Use Addendum for the License Term. 

    10.5. For Certain MDCS Uses:  Licensee's use of MDCS in the manner
    described in Section 3.2.2 of either the Installation and Use Addendum or
    the Academic Installation and Use Addendum may be terminated at any time
    upon sixty days' notice, or sooner if, for any reason, MathWorks is
    involuntarily required to terminate the availability of such use.

11. TERMINATION.  MathWorks may terminate this Agreement and all Licenses
granted hereunder by written notice to Licensee if Licensee breaches any
material term of this Agreement, including failure to pay any License fees due,
and Licensee has not cured such breach within sixty (60) days of written
notification.  MathWorks may immediately terminate this Agreement and all
Licenses granted hereunder if, after requesting and failing to receive from the
Licensee adequate assurances of compliance with the terms of this Agreement,
MathWorks reasonably believes that Licensee is or is intending to breach any
material term of this Agreement.  MathWorks may immediately terminate upon
notice this Agreement and all Licenses granted hereunder should Licensee breach
the terms and conditions of Articles 4, 5, 7, and/or 12.  If Licensee or any of
its Affiliates commences or participates in any legal proceeding against
MathWorks or any of MathWorks' Affiliates challenging or asserting any
intellectual property rights in or against any of the Programs licensed
hereunder, then MathWorks may, without waiving any other legal rights or
remedies available to it, immediately terminate this License. The foregoing
sentence only applies to (a) a Licensee who has as its principal business the
holding of patents and who does not engage, either directly or through an
Affiliate, in any material active business of making products that embody the
patents or (b) a Licensee who engages, either directly or through an Affiliate,
in a principal business of licensing or making available commercial off the
shelf ("COTS") software to Third Parties. Licensee may terminate this License
at any time, for any reason.  Licensee shall not be entitled to any refund if
this License is terminated, except for License fees paid for any Programs for
which the Acceptance Period has not expired at the time of termination.  Upon
termination for any reason, Licensee shall promptly return all but archival
copies of the Programs in Licensee's possession or control, or promptly provide
written certification of their destruction.

12. EXPORT CONTROL.  The Programs may be subject to U.S. export control laws or
other (U.S. and non-U.S.) governmental export and import laws and regulations.
Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement or Third Party agreement,
Licensee's rights under this Agreement may not be exercised by Licensee or any
Third Party in violation of such laws and regulations, nor may this Agreement
be transferred to any party where doing so would result in such a violation.
The terms of any limitation on the use, transfer or re-export of the Programs
imposed by MathWorks in any Destination Control Statement or other document for
the purpose of export control shall prevail over any term in this Agreement.
It shall be Licensee's responsibility to comply with the latest United States
or other governmental export and import regulations. 

13. FEDERAL ACQUISITION.  This provision applies to all acquisitions of the
Programs and Documentation by, for, or through the federal government of the
United States.  By accepting delivery of the Programs or Documentation, the
government hereby agrees that this software or documentation qualifies as
commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation as
such terms are used or defined in FAR 12.212, DFARS Part 227.72, and DFARS
252.227-7014.  Accordingly, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and only
those rights specified in this Agreement, shall pertain to and govern the use,
modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, and disclosure of
the Programs and Documentation by the federal government (or other entity
acquiring for or through the federal government) and shall supersede any
conflicting contractual terms or conditions.  If this License fails to meet the
government's needs or is inconsistent in any respect with federal procurement
law, the government agrees to return the Programs and Documentation, unused, to
MathWorks. 

14. EUROPEAN UNION SOFTWARE DIRECTIVE.  For any Licensed User properly licensed
to use the Programs within the European Union, any contractual provisions of
this Agreement contrary to laws implemented pursuant to Article 6 of Directive
2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on
the legal protection of computer programs or to the exceptions provided for in
Article 5(2) and (3) of such Directive shall be null and void solely to the
extent decompiling, disassembling, or otherwise reverse-engineering of the
Programs is necessary to enable the Licensee to achieve the interoperability of
an independently created program with the Programs or any other permitted
objectives specified by such laws implemented under such Directive
(collectively, the "Permitted Objectives"), consistent with the Directive,
provided that any such information gained is used solely for such Permitted
Objectives and solely in the European Union.

15. TAXES, DUTIES, CUSTOMS.  Absent appropriate exemption certificates or other
conclusive proof of tax exempt status, Licensee shall pay all applicable sales,
use, excise, value-added, and other taxes, duties, levies, assessments, and
governmental charges payable in connection with this Agreement or the Licenses
granted hereunder, excluding taxes based on or measured by MathWorks' income,
for which MathWorks shall be solely responsible. 

16. ASSIGNMENT.  Licensee may not assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement
and any License hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without the
written consent of MathWorks.  Licensee agrees that MathWorks may withhold such
consent if it determines, in its sole discretion, that a principal purpose of
the acquisition of this License was to assign the License to a Third Party.
In the case of any permitted or other lawful assignment or transfer, the terms
of this Agreement including any License hereunder shall be binding upon, and
inure to the benefit of, the transferee or assignee.  

17. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  The Programs should not be relied on as the sole
basis to solve a problem or implement a design whose incorrect solution or
implementation could result in injury to person or property.  If a Program is
employed in such a manner, it is at the Licensee's own risk and MathWorks and
its Licensors explicitly disclaim all liability for such misuse to the extent
allowed by law.  MathWorks' and MathWorks' Licensors' liability for death or
personal injury resulting from negligence or for any other matter in relation
to which liability by law cannot be excluded or limited shall not be excluded
or limited.  Except as aforesaid, (a) any other liability of MathWorks and its
Licensors (whether in relation to breach of contract, negligence or otherwise)
shall not in total exceed the amount paid to MathWorks under this Agreement in
the twelve month period preceding the claim in question, for the Program with
respect to which the liability in question arises; and (b) MathWorks and its
Licensors shall have no liability for any indirect or consequential loss
(whether foreseeable or otherwise and including loss of profits, loss of
business, loss of opportunity, and loss of use of any computer hardware or
software).  Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental
or consequential damages, so the above exclusion or limitation may not apply to
Licensee. 

18. LIMITED WARRANTY/LIMITATION OF REMEDIES.  MathWorks warrants that
MathWorks, on its own behalf or through its Licensors, has the right to grant
the License rights hereunder.  MathWorks warrants that the physical media
provided shall be free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of
ninety (90) days from delivery, or it will be replaced by MathWorks at no cost
to Licensee.  MathWorks further warrants, for a period of one (1) year from
delivery or for the term of the License, whichever is less, that each copy of
each Program will conform in all material respects to the description of such
Program's operation in the Documentation.  In the event that a Program does not
operate as warranted, Licensee's exclusive remedy and MathWorks' sole liability
under this warranty shall be the correction or workaround by MathWorks of major
defects within a reasonable time.  Should such correction or workaround be
impractical, MathWorks may, at its option, terminate the relevant License and
refund the initial License fee paid to MathWorks for such Program.  All
requests for warranty assistance should be directed to The MathWorks, Inc., 3
Apple Hill Drive, Natick, MA 01760-2098, U.S.A.

19. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  Except for warranties expressly set forth in
Article 18 of this Agreement (or as implied by law where the law provides that
the particular terms implied cannot be excluded by contract), any and all
Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance Services are delivered "as
is" and MathWorks makes and the Licensee receives no additional express or
implied warranties.  MathWorks and its Licensors hereby expressly disclaim any
and all other conditions, warranties, or other terms of any kind or nature
concerning the Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance Services
(including, without limitation, any with regard to infringement,
merchantability, quality, accuracy, or fitness for a particular purpose or
Licensee's purpose).  MathWorks also expressly disclaims any warranties that
may be implied from usage of trade, course of dealing, or course of
performance.  Except for the express warranties stated in Article 18 of this
Agreement, the Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance Services are
provided with all faults, and the entire risk of satisfactory quality,
performance, accuracy, and effort is with Licensee.  MathWorks does not warrant
that the Programs and Documentation will operate without interruption or be
error free.  Some states and countries do not allow limitations on how long an
implied warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to Licensee.  The
warranty in Article 18 gives Licensee specific legal rights and Licensee may
also have other rights which vary from state to state and country to country.
Licensee accepts responsibility for its use of the Programs and the results
obtained therefrom.

20. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION.  This Agreement shall be interpreted, enforced
and construed and the rights of the parties hereunder governed in all respects
by the laws of the State of Delaware United States of America, without regard
to its conflicts of law provisions, and both parties consent to the
jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in said State and consent
to the service of process, pleadings and notices in connection with any and all
actions initiated in such courts.  The parties agree that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and binding and may be
enforced in any other jurisdiction.  To the extent any governing law, treaty,
or regulation is in conflict with this Agreement, the conflicting terms of this
Agreement shall be superseded only to the extent required by such law, treaty,
or regulation.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be otherwise unlawful,
void, or otherwise unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the
maximum extent permissible.  In either case, the remainder of this Agreement
shall not be affected.  The parties agree that the U.N. Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement.  The
parties further agree that the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act,
or any version thereof, adopted by any state, in any form ("UCITA"), shall not
apply to this Agreement.  To the extent that UCITA is applicable, the parties
agree to opt out of the applicability of UCITA pursuant to the Opt-Out
provision(s) contained therein. 

21. COMPLIANCE WITH LICENSES.  Licensee agrees to notify MathWorks promptly
upon discovery of any failure to comply with this Agreement.  Licensee agrees
that, no more than once every twelve (12) months or within a reasonable time
after a transfer, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity,
MathWorks or its authorized representative shall, upon reasonable prior notice,
have the right to inspect Licensee's and Licensee's Affiliates' records,
systems, and facilities, during normal business hours, to verify that
Licensee's and its Affiliates' use of the Programs is in conformity with valid
licenses and otherwise comply with this Agreement.  If a verification discloses
that Licensee's or any of its Affiliates' use is not in conformity with a valid
license, Licensee shall immediately take all necessary steps to cure any past
defaults, including paying any unpaid license fees, to bring Licensee's or any
of its Affiliates' use into conformity.  

22. LICENSE MANAGEMENT.  The Programs contain technology for the prevention of
unlicensed use.  The Programs require activation to exercise your rights under
this Agreement.  You may also need to activate if you redesignate the Programs

by MathWorks or which replaces any component of the Programs.  Licensee shall
not otherwise use the Programs to compete with the products or businesses of
MathWorks, including by distributing Libraries, or any form of an entire
Program or a substantial portion of a Program.  

4. DEFINITIONS.

    4.1. Application.  A software file that Licensee has created by either (a)
    using a MathWorks Program to compile or translate Licensee created Source
    Code or (b) incorporating or linking any part of any Source Code, library
    file, or other Program Component provided with the Program.  An Application
    must contain original code developed by Licensee and must provide
    substantial functionality not contained in, or provided by, the Program
    Components that are incorporated into such Application.  If a software file
    created by a Licensee incorporates Program Components, but does not meet
    the requirements of the previous sentence, then it is a Derivative Form (as
    defined below).  An Application may contain Linked Object Code which, if
    such Object Code was not Linked to the Application and was a standalone
    file, would otherwise have been deemed a Derivative Form. 

    4.2. Application License.  A license provided by Licensee to its end-users
    for the installation and use of Licensee's Application and any Third Party
    Software made available for use with the Application.

    4.3. Generated Forms.  The output of the MATLAB Compiler, the MathWorks
    Coder Programs, and other MathWorks' code generation Programs in the form
    of Source Code or Object Code, as well as such Source Code converted to
    Object Code or Linked forms. 

    4.4. Derivative Forms.  A software file that Licensee has derived from one
    or more Program Components (including without limitation by incorporating,
    translating, or modifying, in whole or in part, any Program Component), and
    which, if modified or copied without MathWorks' authorization, would
    constitute a copyright infringement or breach of the Agreement.  A software
    file created by Licensee which qualifies as an "Application" under the
    above definition shall not be deemed a Derivative Form.

    4.5. Linked.   An executable or loadable file created by a compiler or
    linker program combining Object Code module files.

    4.6. MAT-file.  The file format in which MATLAB stores data.

    4.7. MATLAB Runtime.  MATLAB Runtime support libraries and other files for
    deployment of Applications created with the MATLAB Compiler. 

    4.8. Object Code.  The code created by a system compiler from source code;
    also called "machine-readable code".  Object Code can be Linked with an
    appropriate linker to resolve address references and may be combined with
    other Object Code for targeted execution on a specific processor.  Object
    Code includes "Object Code libraries" and "shared libraries," which are
    groupings of Object Code for specific purposes.

    4.9. Program Component.  Any portion of, or file provided with, a Program.

    4.10. Source Code.  Human-readable program code written in a higher-level
    language such as C, C++, Java, MATLAB, MDL, VHDL, Verilog, or Fortran,
    which must be translated or compiled into machine-readable language before
    it can be executed by a computer.  Source Code also includes header files
    and other human-readable files necessary for a Program to be compiled in
    the higher-level language.

    4.11. Standalone Application.  An Application created using programming
    languages and tools other than the Programs, which executes outside of the
    Programs.

    4.12. Deployment Program.  The MATLAB Compiler, MATLAB Compiler SDK, and
    any of MathWorks Coder Programs as defined in Section 4.13 below. 

    4.13. MathWorks Coder Programs.  MATLAB Coder, Filter Design HDL Coder,
    Simulink Coder, HDL Coder, Simulink PLC Coder, and Embedded Coder.

5. DEPLOYMENT PROGRAMS.  Licensed Users of MathWorks' Deployment Programs may
automatically generate code from MATLAB code files, Simulink/Stateflow
diagrams, and other representations, into Generated Forms.  Furthermore,
Licensee may copy and deploy these Generated Forms for use outside of the
Programs.  

    5.1. Deployment from MathWorks Coder Programs.  MathWorks provides
    directories of C, C++, Assembly, linker command files, template makefiles,
    project files, and TLC source code files with Programs that implement the
    real-time framework.  Such files made available in any of the MathWorks
    Coder Programs may only be modified and deployed in Source Code or Linked
    Object Code form for different development targets when used with such
    Programs or with code generated by such Programs as part of, and only as
    required by, a larger Standalone Application. MathWorks Coder Programs
    cannot be used to create an Application (a) providing capability similar to
    the capabilities of any of the Programs; (b) providing functionality or
    behavior similar to that of the MATLAB command line or scripting and
    programming capabilities; (c) allowing operation of the code generation
    capabilities of Programs; (d) providing access to an entire Program or a
    substantial portion of a Program; or (e) enabling evaluation of end-user
    code or expressions.

        5.1.1. Licensee may copy and deploy these files outside of the Programs
        in Linked Object Code form or Source Code form, if only used in
        combination with code generated by those Programs as part of a larger
        standalone Application.
 
        5.1.2. No further fees shall be due to MathWorks for such deployment
        within Licensee's Application, regardless of whether the Application is
        deployed solely for Licensee's Internal Operations or to Third Parties.

    5.2. Deployment from MATLAB Compiler. Licensed Users may deploy copies of
    Applications generated by the MATLAB Compiler that incorporate compiled
    versions of MATLAB code files from licensed Programs required for such
    Applications.  Licensee may also use and distribute the MATLAB Runtime
    together with such Applications for the sole purpose of running the
    Applications.  Licensee is prohibited from making copies of the MATLAB
    Runtime accessible to any Third Party separate from or for use other than
    with a Licensed User's Application, or provide the MATLAB Runtime for
    service bureau or similar service use.
 
    Licensee agrees to employ the same security measures to protect the MATLAB
    Runtime as it uses to safeguard Licensee's own proprietary intellectual
    property, but in no event less than reasonable care.

    No additional license fees shall be due to MathWorks for the distribution
    of the required MATLAB code files incorporated in the generated
    Application, or for the distribution of the MATLAB Runtime when deployed
    together with such Applications, regardless of whether the Application and
    the MATLAB Runtime are distributed for the purposes of Licensee's Internal
    Operations or to Third Parties. 
 
        5.2.1. Licensed User may include, by compilation for deployment, only
        those select MATLAB code files from the licensed Programs required for
        the Application. 

        5.2.2. In no event shall Licensee distribute any library header files.

        5.2.3. Licensee's Application may not provide capability similar to the
        capabilities of any of the Programs or provide functionality or
        behavior similar to that of the MATLAB command line or scripting and
        programming capabilities, nor may Licensee's Application enable
        evaluation of end-user code or expressions.  

        5.2.4. Licensee's Application may not allow operation of the code
        generation capabilities of Programs.

        5.2.5. Licensee's Application may not provide access to an entire
        Program or a substantial portion of a Program. 

        5.2.6. Licensee's Application incorporating any functionality of the
        Parallel Computing Toolbox ("PCT") may enable the same or fewer number
        of local workers provided by the PCT used to build the Application,
        even if the Application's end user does not possess a license to the
        PCT. 

        5.2.7. Licensee shall include the notice "MATLAB(r). (c) 1984 - [INSERT
        YEAR MATLAB VERSION PUBLISHED] The MathWorks, Inc." in the deployed
        Application's About Box, or similar visible location, and in the
        applicable documentation distributed with each copy of the Application.

        5.2.8. Licensee may not modify or remove any proprietary notice or
        license file that is included with the MATLAB Runtime. 
 
    5.3. Simulink Desktop Real-Time.  Licensee may not incorporate Simulink
    Desktop Real-Time into an Application for deployment without contracting
    with MathWorks for an OEM or VAR agreement.

    5.4. Simulink Real-Time.  Licensee may develop Applications that
    incorporate Object Code derived from Program Components of Simulink
    Real-Time which are required for the Application and that have been
    compiled or otherwise obtained from Simulink Coder on a single development
    PC, download that Application to a target PC, and distribute that
    Application beyond the target PC. 

    No further fees shall be due to MathWorks for such distribution of
    Licensee's Application, regardless of whether the Application is
    distributed solely for Licensee's Internal Operations or to Third Parties.
    Additionally, the Simulink Real-Time Program allows for the distribution
    beyond the development PC of API DLLs as part of the Application and other
    Applications exported from Simulink Real-Time Explorer.  No further fees
    shall be due to MathWorks for such distribution, regardless of whether the
    API DLLs are distributed solely for Licensee's Internal Operations or to
    Third Parties. 

6. OTHER SOURCE CODE AND SHARED OBJECT CODE LIBRARIES. 

    6.1. Programs may include selected Source Code and shared Object Code
    library files that implement various documented application programming
    interface capabilities of the Programs for which the Source Code or shared
    library file is part. 

        6.1.1. Licensed User may use and modify the selected Source Code files
        solely for creation of Licensee's own Applications. Licensee may copy
        and distribute Object Code compiled from this Source Code, but only as
        either standalone Object Code file (regardless whether a Derivative
        Form) or Object Code Linked to the Application, and only for use with
        and deployment of Licensee's own Application.  

        6.1.2. Licensee may use, copy and distribute shared Object Code library
        files (regardless whether a Derivative Form) for deployment of
        Licensee's own Application, but only if a header file exists in the
        Program for the shared library file. Licensee may not copy or
        distribute header files themselves.

        6.1.3. Licensee may not transfer Source Code, development rights, or
        development capabilities for any Source Code or Object Code to any
        Third Party.

    6.2. MAT-files.  Licensed User may create and distribute Applications that
    read MAT-files using the MAT-file API, however, if such Applications are
    distributed to Third Parties, they must also implement MAT-file write
    capability.  

7. DERIVATIVE FORMS.  A Licensee shall only be permitted to distribute a
Derivative Form to Third Parties (a) to the extent expressly permitted under
Articles 5 or 6 of this Addendum, or (b) subject to the requirements of this
Article 7.  A Licensee may only distribute a Derivative Form to a Third Party
under this Article 7 if such Third Party is bound by a Software License
Agreement with MathWorks that requires such Third Party to treat such
Derivative Forms received from Licensee as such Third Party's own Derivative
Form thereunder.  Licensee agrees that if such a Third Party provides Licensee
with software that is a Derivative Form under the terms of such Third Party's
Software License Agreement with MathWorks (or would otherwise be a Derivative
Form under the terms of this Agreement), then Licensee shall treat such
software as a Derivative Form hereunder as if Licensee has modified or
generated the software itself.  

8. WEB APPLICATIONS.  Programs licensed under the Concurrent, the Network Named
User, the Individual, and the Total Academic Headcount License Options may be
called by means of a web interface in accordance with the following conditions.
Programs licensed under any other License Option may not be called via a web
interface.  

For the Concurrent License Option.  Programs licensed under the Concurrent
License Option may be called via a web application, provided the web
application does not provide access to the MATLAB command line, or any of the
licensed Programs with code generation capabilities.  In addition, Licensed
Users may not provide access to an entire Program or a substantial portion of a
Program, nor may such application enable evaluation of end-user code or
expressions.  Such operation of an application via a web interface or web
server may be provided to an unlimited number of web clients, at no additional
cost, for Licensee's own use for its Internal Operations, and for use by Third
Parties.
 
For the Network Named User and Individual License Options.  Programs licensed
under the Network Named User and Individual License Options may be called via a
web application, provided the web application does not provide access to the
MATLAB command line, or any of the licensed Programs with code generation
capabilities, and such application is only accessed by designated Network Named
User or Individual licensees of such Programs.  In addition, Licensed Users may
not provide access to an entire Program or a substantial portion of a Program,
nor may such application enable evaluation of end-user code or expression.

For the Total Academic Headcount License Option.  Programs licensed under the
Total Academic Headcount License Option may be called via a web application,
provided the web application does not provide access to the MATLAB command
line, or any of the licensed Programs with code generation capabilities.  In
addition, Licensed Users may not provide access to an entire Program or a
substantial portion of a Program, nor may such application enable evaluation of
end-user code or expressions.  Such operation of an application via a web
interface may be provided to an unlimited number of web browser clients, at no
additional cost, for Licensee's own use for its Academic Internal Operations,
and for use by Third Parties.

9. APPLICATION LICENSING.  For any distribution of Applications containing
Object Code or Generated Forms to:

    9.1. Licensee's internal organization:  Licensee shall take appropriate
    action by instruction, agreement, or otherwise with any recipients of the
